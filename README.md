# React Learning Journey

Welcome!   
This repository documents my journey of learning **React**. It serves as a personal learning space and a public record of my progress as I explore modern frontend development.

##  Purpose of This Repository

The goal of this repo is to:

- Learn React fundamentals and best practices
- Practice concepts through small experiments and features
- Track my progress over time
- Share what I’ve learned with others who may be on the same path

This is a **learning-focused repository**, so you may see refactors, experiments, and evolving patterns as my understanding improves.

##  Tech Stack

- **React**
- **Vite** (for fast development & builds)
- **JavaScript / JSX**
- **CSS** (or other styling approaches as I explore)

##  Topics I’m Exploring

Some of the concepts covered (and continuously expanding):

- Components & JSX
- Props and State
- Event handling
- Conditional rendering
- Lists & keys
- Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.)
- Project structure & best practices
- Tooling with Vite

> This list will grow as I progress
